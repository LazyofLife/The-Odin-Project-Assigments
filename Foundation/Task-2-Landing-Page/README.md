The goal of this assignment is to practice **basic CSS** and **Flexbox layouting** by recreating a landing page based on a provided design guideline.

## 📐 Landing Page Structure

```plaintext
- Header
- main
  - section Hero
  - section Information
  - section Testimonial
  - section CTA
- Footer
```

* **Header** → Logo + navigation (Home, About, Contact Us).
* **Hero** → Introduction text, CTA button, and illustration image.
* **Information** → Four information cards with icons and short descriptions.
* **Testimonial** → Blockquote with testimonial text and citation.
* **CTA Section** → Simple call-to-action message and button.
* **Footer** → Copyright text.

## 📖 Notes

* The project uses **semantic HTML5 elements** (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
* **Classes** are minimized and only used where necessary (Hero, Information, CTA sections follow a BEM-like approach).
* Navigation highlights the current page link using `aria-current="page"`.
* Built with **pure HTML and CSS** only.
* Responsiveness is **not yet implemented** (to be addressed in later lessons).
