# Odin Recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project - Foundations: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).  
The goal of this assignment is to practice **basic HTML** with a focus on:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)
- Linking between pages
- Building a simple multi-page website

---

## 📂 Project Sitemap
```
index.html
recipes-page/
├── burrito.html
├── kebab.html
└── pizza.html
```

- **`index.html`** → the main page containing links to all recipes.  
- **`recipes-page/*.html`** → individual recipe pages.  

---

## 🧾 Recipe Page Structure
Each recipe page follows a consistent layout:
1. **Main menu link** → navigation back to the homepage.  
2. **Content** → title, description, image, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.  
3. **Credit** → image sources and attribution.
